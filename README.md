# Summer-Drake-Quest (2020)
---
Welcome! This is a small game project created by a few Drake freshmen over the summer of 2020. The objective of the game is to navigate through 4 rooms to find a set of keys that will unlock the way to the attic, where the player must challenge a boss. All to acquire their grandfather's sword. 
This game was created by: Jake Elafros, Katja Mathesius, and Saul Varshavsky. With supervision from Dr. Timothy Urness
